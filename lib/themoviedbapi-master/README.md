TheMovieDB API
================

This library provides a java-wrapper around the [JSON API](http://api.themoviedb.org/) provided by
[TMdB](http://themoviedb.org), which is an open database for movie and film content.



Setup
-----

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/movito/movito-utils/tmdb-api/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/movito/movito-utils/tmdb-api/_latestVersion)

Just add it as dependency to your project. It's available via [jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter)

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>info.movito</groupId>
    <artifactId>themoviedbapi</artifactId>
    <version>1.4</version>
</dependency>
```
Read the [Set me up](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) section first, if you haven't addded jcenter as a repository to your pom.xml yet.

Or just add it via gradle when developing for Android:

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies{
    compile group: 'info.movito', name: 'themoviedbapi', version:'1.4'
}
```


Usage
-----

To get started you need a [TMdB API key](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/). With this you can instantiate
`info.movito.themoviedbapi.TmdbApi`, which has getters for all subcategories of the API.

For instance to get a movie by ID, do the following:

```
TmdbMovies movies = new TmdbApi("<apikey>").getMovies();
MovieDb movie = movies.getMovie(5353, "en");
```

The wrapper implements all major parts of the JSON API as detailed out in the [TMdB API documentation]((http://api.themoviedb.org/)).
However, as the latter is subject to constant change, feel welcome to point out missing bits by submitting a ticket.
Or even better, just send us a pull request!

Project Logging
---------------

This project uses [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org) to abstract the logging in the project. To use the logging in your own
project you should add one of the provided [adapter bindings](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html).



Notes & Acknowledgements
-------------------------

The library was developed for [Movito](http://www.movito.info) to interact with tmdb services. This library has been
inspired by [api-themoviedb](https://github.com/Omertron/api-themoviedb) but has been rewritten to provide a more open
license, a more clean API and to expose more features of the TMDB json api.
